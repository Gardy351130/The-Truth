        <div class="intro-box">
            Narrative framing describes the process through which disparate signals, claims, and contextual cues are organised into coherent explanatory structures within communication environments. Coherence—the property of internal consistency and logical flow—functions as a substitute for evidentiary strength, enabling narratives to stabilise interpretation independent of verification. When information is integrated into narrative frames, individuals exhibit increased resistance to contradiction, reduced questioning, and a preference for maintaining consistency over accuracy. This chapter examines how narrative structures operate as interface mechanisms that consolidate trust, shape evaluation boundaries, and determine where verification processes terminate.
        </div>
        
        <p>Narrative framing emerges from cognitive systems adapted to organise fragmented information into unified causal and temporal structures. Human cognition exhibits a strong preference for coherent explanations over disconnected facts, a tendency documented across decision-making, memory, and belief formation domains (Pennington & Hastie, 1988; Schank & Abelson, 1995). When individuals encounter information, they actively construct narrative frameworks that connect events, attribute causality, establish temporal sequence, and resolve ambiguity through story completion (Bruner, 1991). These narratives function not merely as summaries of information but as interpretive structures that determine which details are salient, which connections are plausible, and which conclusions are acceptable (Herman, 2009). Narrative coherence—the degree to which elements fit together in an internally consistent manner—operates as a heuristic signal of validity, with coherent accounts perceived as more credible than incoherent ones regardless of underlying accuracy (Schank, 1999).</p>

        <p>Communication environments structure narrative framing through sequencing, omission, emphasis, and contextual positioning. The order in which information is presented shapes which narrative frames become available; early information establishes interpretive anchors that constrain how subsequent details are integrated (Lagnado & Sloman, 2004). Omission of contradictory or ambiguous information enables smoother narrative construction by removing elements that would require additional explanation or create internal tension (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Emphasis through repetition, visual prominence, or temporal positioning directs attention toward specific details, increasing their weight within narrative structures (Zillmann, 1999). Contextual cues—genre markers, institutional signals, authority indicators—prime specific narrative templates, enabling rapid integration of new information into pre-existing explanatory frameworks (Entman, 1993). These structural features operate collectively to shape which narratives individuals construct from available information, creating conditions where interpretive frames are constrained by environmental design rather than emerging solely from autonomous reasoning.</p>

        <p>Coherence substitutes for evidentiary strength through mechanisms that prioritise internal consistency over external validation. When individuals evaluate claims or explanations, coherent narratives are judged as more believable than fragmented accounts even when the coherent version lacks supporting evidence (Pennington & Hastie, 1992). This preference reflects cognitive efficiency; coherent explanations require less processing effort, resolve ambiguity more completely, and provide satisfying closure that reduces the motivation for further investigation (Kintsch, 1998). The relationship between coherence and perceived validity operates bidirectionally: narratives that feel coherent are assumed to reflect accurate causal structures, while claims that disrupt coherence are treated with suspicion or rejected as implausible (Thagard, 1989). This substitution enables narrative framing to function as a trust mechanism within communication systems, where the structural property of internal consistency generates credibility independent of whether the narrative corresponds to verifiable facts (Sanford & Emmott, 2012).</p>

        <p>Narrative closure describes the psychological state achieved when explanatory gaps are resolved and causal sequences reach completion. Once closure is achieved, individuals exhibit reduced receptivity to new information, particularly information that would require reopening resolved questions or revising established interpretations (Kruglanski & Webster, 1996). This resistance operates through multiple mechanisms: cognitive dissonance creates discomfort when contradictory information threatens coherent narratives, motivating dismissal or reinterpretation of discrepant evidence (Festinger, 1957); fluency effects make familiar narratives feel more valid than alternative explanations requiring unfamiliar reasoning (Alter & Oppenheimer, 2009); commitment to prior judgments increases psychological investment in maintaining existing interpretations (Kunda, 1990). Communication systems that deliver narratives with clear beginnings, middles, and endings exploit these closure effects, creating conditions where interpretive stability persists even when subsequent evidence contradicts core narrative elements (Graesser, Singer, & Trabasso, 1994).</p>

        <p>Ambiguity resolution through narrative framing enables disparate or incomplete information to coalesce into definite interpretations. When signals contain gaps, contradictions, or multiple plausible meanings, narrative structures provide templates that specify how ambiguity should be resolved (Gigerenzer & Selten, 2002). These templates operate through learned associations, cultural schemas, and genre conventions that indicate which interpretations are normative within specific contexts (Mandler, 1984). An incomplete sequence of events becomes interpretable when mapped onto familiar narrative patterns; a set of disconnected claims becomes coherent when organised according to recognisable causal structures (Turner, 1996). The process of fitting information into narrative frames requires selecting among possible interpretations, a selection often guided by which resolution preserves coherence, aligns with expectations, or reinforces prior beliefs rather than which interpretation maximises accuracy (Graesser, Millis, & Zwaan, 1997). Once ambiguity is resolved through narrative integration, the selected interpretation tends to persist, with individuals treating their constructed narrative as though it reflects objective reality rather than one possible reading among alternatives (Schank & Abelson, 1977).</p>

        <p>Suppression of conflicting information occurs when details threaten narrative coherence. Individuals encountering information that contradicts established narrative frames exhibit several patterns: selectively attending to details that support existing narratives while overlooking discrepant information; reinterpreting contradictory evidence to align with preferred explanations; dismissing inconsistent claims as anomalies, errors, or irrelevant exceptions (Lord, Ross, & Lepper, 1979). These suppression mechanisms operate largely outside conscious awareness, functioning as automatic processes that preserve interpretive stability (Gilbert, Krull, & Malone, 1990). Communication environments can facilitate suppression by structuring information flow such that contradictions are temporally separated from supporting evidence, reducing the likelihood that inconsistencies are noticed simultaneously (Lewandowsky, Ecker, Seifert, Schwarz, & Cook, 2012). The interaction between narrative coherence and information suppression creates conditions where belief persists not because disconfirming evidence is unavailable but because it is systematically excluded from the interpretive framework through which new information is evaluated (Nickerson, 1998).</p>

        <p>Retrospective rationalisation describes processes through which individuals reinterpret past events to align with current narrative frames. When narratives are revised or new information is integrated, memory of prior details shifts to maintain coherence with updated interpretations (Schacter, 1999). This rationalisation operates bidirectionally: current narratives reshape memory of past events, while memories are selectively retrieved to support present explanations (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). The effect creates conditions where individuals believe their interpretations have remained consistent over time even when substantial revisions have occurred, a phenomenon that strengthens confidence in narrative frames by obscuring the contingent and constructed nature of interpretive processes (Ross, 1989). Communication systems that present information in temporal sequences exploit retrospective rationalisation by enabling individuals to integrate new claims into existing narratives through reinterpretation of prior content, creating coherence retrospectively rather than requiring consistency at the point of initial presentation (Bartlett, 1932).</p>

        <p>Emotional alignment within narrative structures strengthens coherence through affective resonance. Narratives that evoke consistent emotional responses across their elements feel more unified and compelling than accounts that oscillate between affective states without resolution (Oatley, 1992). Emotional continuity functions as a coherence cue; when information generates emotions that align with the trajectory of a narrative—tension building toward resolution, uncertainty transitioning to clarity, threat culminating in relief—the narrative structure feels more complete and satisfying (Tan, 1996). This affective coherence operates independently of logical consistency; emotionally resonant narratives may contain factual gaps or causal ambiguities yet still achieve psychological closure through emotional arc completion (Mar & Oatley, 2008). Communication environments structure emotional alignment through pacing, emphasis, and contextual framing, creating conditions where affective experiences reinforce rather than challenge narrative interpretations (Gross & Levenson, 1995). The integration of emotional and cognitive coherence produces narrative frames that resist revision through both rational and affective pathways.</p>

        <p>Interaction between narrative framing and authority signals documented in prior chapters creates compounding trust effects. When information is presented by credible sources and simultaneously integrated into coherent narratives, perceived validity increases beyond what either mechanism would produce independently (Chaiken & Maheswaran, 1994). Authority signals anchor initial credibility while narrative coherence stabilises interpretation over time, creating conditions where belief persists even if the authority foundation weakens or contradictory evidence emerges (Hovland, Janis, & Kelley, 1953). Narratives attributed to authoritative sources inherit credibility through trust transfer while simultaneously validating the authority through coherent presentation; the circular reinforcement between source credibility and narrative quality creates stable belief structures resistant to external challenge (Pornpitakpan, 2004). This interaction operates particularly effectively in environments where authority and narrative framing are structured to appear independent—perceived objectivity increases when coherent narratives seem to emerge from facts rather than being constructed by interested sources, even when structural analysis reveals deliberate framing (Bennett & Iyengar, 2008).</p>

        <p>Anchoring of interpretation following narrative frame acceptance describes how initial explanatory structures constrain subsequent reasoning. Once individuals construct or adopt a narrative framework, new information is evaluated primarily through its fit with the established frame rather than through independent assessment (Mussweiler & Strack, 1999). This anchoring creates path dependency in interpretation; early narrative frames shape which evidence is attended to, how ambiguity is resolved, and which conclusions appear plausible, making alternative interpretations progressively less accessible as the initial frame becomes entrenched (Chapman & Johnson, 1999). Communication systems that establish narrative frames early in information sequences exploit anchoring effects by constraining interpretive possibilities before complete information is available, creating conditions where subsequent details are assimilated into predetermined structures rather than generating independent conclusions (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). The anchoring function of narratives operates even when individuals are explicitly warned about framing effects, as the cognitive efficiency of working within established frameworks overwhelms deliberative efforts to consider alternatives (Wilson, Houston, Etling, & Brekke, 1996).</p>

        <p>Increased resistance to revision after narrative closure operates through multiple reinforcing mechanisms. Cognitive investment in coherent explanations creates psychological costs associated with abandoning established narratives; individuals prefer to defend existing interpretations rather than undertake the cognitive labor of constructing alternative frameworks (Abelson, 1986). Social factors reinforce resistance when narratives are shared; publicly committing to an interpretation increases reluctance to revise beliefs even when private doubts emerge, as revision threatens social identity and interpersonal consistency (Staw, 1976). Emotional attachment to narratives that align with identity, values, or prior experiences creates affective barriers to revision, with contradictory information generating discomfort that motivates dismissal rather than integration (Sherman & Cohen, 2006). The combination of cognitive, social, and emotional factors produces belief perseverance, where narratives remain stable across substantial evidence accumulation that would, under alternative conditions, prompt reconsideration (Anderson, Lepper, & Ross, 1980). Communication environments need not continuously reinforce narratives once closure is achieved; the structural stability of coherent explanations maintains interpretive frames with minimal ongoing support.</p>

        <p>Preference for internally consistent explanations over accurate ones manifests across multiple domains. When individuals choose between accurate but fragmented accounts and coherent but partially inaccurate narratives, coherence often prevails (Pennington & Hastie, 1988). This preference reflects both the cognitive ease of processing unified explanations and the psychological satisfaction derived from closure and comprehension (Keil, 2006). The preference persists even when accuracy is explicitly valued; individuals often fail to recognise the trade-off between coherence and accuracy, experiencing coherent narratives as though they were inherently more accurate because they feel more complete and logically sound (Lombrozo, 2007). Communication systems that prioritise narrative coherence over factual precision exploit this preference by constructing explanatory frames that resolve ambiguity and provide satisfying closure at the expense of acknowledging complexity, uncertainty, or contradictory evidence (Propp, 1968). The structural consequence is that information environments favouring narrative over verification create conditions where beliefs stabilise around coherent stories rather than around accurate representations of underlying phenomena.</p>

        <p>Narrative framing interacts with temporal pressure and attention limitations documented in earlier chapters to shape evaluation depth. Under time constraints or cognitive load, reliance on narrative coherence increases as individuals default to heuristic processing that favours internally consistent explanations over detailed evidence assessment (Forgas, 1995). The combination of temporal pressure and narrative framing creates conditions where cursory evaluation of coherence substitutes for substantive verification, enabling rapid belief formation based on whether information fits recognisable story structures rather than whether it is supported by independent evidence (Chaiken, 1980). Communication environments that deliver coherent narratives under time pressure exploit dual-process cognition, engaging System 1 pattern recognition while limiting System 2 deliberative analysis (Kahneman, 2011). The efficiency gains from relying on narrative coherence come at the cost of reduced scrutiny, creating systematic biases toward accepting well-structured but potentially inaccurate explanations over poorly presented but factually sound alternatives.</p>

        <p>The relationship between narrative framing and aggregation mechanisms examined in prior chapters reveals how simplified metrics reinforce narrative interpretations. Quantitative proxies—ratings, rankings, engagement metrics—often function as narrative validation signals, with high numbers interpreted as evidence that a coherent explanation is widely accepted and therefore likely accurate (Messing & Westwood, 2014). The integration of narrative coherence and metric aggregation creates compound trust architectures where story structure and social proof mutually reinforce perceived validity (Sundar, 2008). This interaction operates bidirectionally; coherent narratives make metrics appear more meaningful by providing interpretive context, while metrics make narratives appear more credible by suggesting external validation (Flanagin & Metzger, 2013). Communication systems that combine narrative framing with aggregated signals create conditions where belief formation relies minimally on direct verification, instead stabilising through the interaction between story coherence and numerical proxies that substitute for evidence assessment.</p>

        <p>Narrative framing operates as a terminal interface mechanism within communication environments. While earlier chapters document how attention is directed, authority is signalled, metrics are aggregated, and temporal pressure is applied, narrative framing integrates these elements into unified structures that determine where questioning terminates. Coherent narratives provide psychological closure that reduces motivation for further investigation; the completion of explanatory arcs signals that understanding has been achieved, diminishing perceived need for verification (Kruglanski, 2004). This termination function positions narrative framing as the final layer through which trust stabilises—once information is integrated into a coherent story that aligns with authority signals, aggregated metrics, and temporal cues, belief persists independent of ongoing validation. The structural result is that communication environments need not prevent access to contradictory information; instead, they structure narrative frames such that coherence itself functions as a verification substitute, enabling stable interpretation without requiring individuals to engage in substantive evidence assessment.</p>

        <div class="separator"></div>

        <p>Narrative framing organises fragmented signals into coherent explanatory structures, with internal consistency substituting for evidentiary strength within communication environments. Coherence generates psychological closure that increases resistance to revision, reduces questioning, and enables preference for internally consistent explanations over accurate ones. Through suppression of conflicting information, retrospective rationalisation, emotional alignment, and interaction with authority signals, narratives stabilise interpretation independent of verification. Narrative framing functions as a terminal interface mechanism where trust consolidates and evaluation terminates, creating conditions where belief persists through story structure rather than through substantive evidence assessment. Understanding narrative coherence as a mechanism clarifies how communication systems shape interpretation boundaries and determine where verification processes end.</p>
